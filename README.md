## What is here

TBA

## Run the pluto notebook

1. Download a copy of [this csv file](https://www.homermultitext.org/morphology/morphology-current.csv) to the `pluto` directory
2. Start a Pluto notebook server, and open `pluto/morphology-nb.jl`

Be patient when the notebook first loads:  loading the required libraries and reading in all of the morphological data can take a while.  Once you see that the last section of your notebook has fully loaded, parsing and display of results should be more or less instaneous.
